This project is mainly to make notes. 

Take note, It has to be run from the virtual environment included if you choose to clone the project, hence please clone both folders if intersted in using the app. 

After cloning project, whilst being inside the smartNotesProject containing "smartnotes" and "linkedInsmartnotes_virtualEnv" run the following commands:

2 - then cd into the smartnotes folder and run -> python manage.py runserver
3 - copy localhost address and paste in address bar and click on "signup" top right corner.
